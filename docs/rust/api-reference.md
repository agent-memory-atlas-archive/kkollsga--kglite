# API reference

The curated, documented surface — `kglite::api::*`. Items outside
this surface (`kglite::graph::*`, `kglite::datatypes::*`, etc.) are
implementation details and may move in any release. See
[Stability policy](#stability-policy) for what pre-1.0 guarantees.

For per-symbol API docs (function signatures, struct fields,
trait method docs), use **[docs.rs/kglite](https://docs.rs/kglite)**.
This page is the curated inventory. If you're building a library
that *produces* kglite graphs, see [Building on kglite](building-on-kglite.md).

## Stability policy

`kglite::api::*` — and the `kglite-mcp-server` library surface — are
**exact-baseline-locked in CI** (cargo-public-api, pinned nightly): accidental
drift cannot merge, because the generated public-API listing is diffed against a
committed baseline on every PR. The `include/kglite.h` C header is drift-checked
the same way (cbindgen vs the committed header).

Pre-1.0, the policy is:

- **Any release, including a PATCH, may ship a documented breaking change.**
  KGLite's crates ship in lockstep and deliberately ship breaking engine
  changes in patch bumps; the version number is not a compatibility signal.
  Every intentional break ships with a `CHANGELOG.md` entry naming the
  removed items and their replacements — the changelog, not the bump size, is
  the migration contract. Embedders should pin an exact version
  (`kglite = "=X.Y.Z"`) and upgrade against the changelog. *(This paragraph
  previously promised "patch releases never break the API"; 0.15.9 removed
  public items in a patch, per the actual policy, and this page was the
  outlier.)*
- New options land under **0.14's options-struct convention** (`*Options`
  structs, `#[non_exhaustive]` + `Default`), so adding an option is a
  non-breaking change rather than a signature break.

**1.0 criterion:** the 0.14 surface — after the options-struct pass on
`api::algorithms` — soaks across releases without needing a breaking correction.
When the curated facade proves stable in the field, we cut 1.0 and the pre-1.0
"any release may break" latitude ends.

## Engine types

| Item | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DirGraph` / `KnowledgeGraph` | `kglite::api::*` | Core graph handle/storage wrapper spanning memory, mapped, and disk modes. |
| `GraphRead` / `GraphWrite` | `kglite::api::*` | Storage-independent read/mutation traits; `GraphRead` is GAT-based and not object-safe. |
| Storage/config types | `kglite::api::storage::*` | Mode selection, construction, and lifecycle configuration. |
| `Value` | `kglite::api::Value` | Every value Cypher can return: scalars, `List`, `Map`, `Node`, `Relationship`, `Path`, …. |
| `NodeValue` / `PathValue` / `RelValue` | `kglite::api::*` | Per-variant carriers; pattern-match into them without deriving accessors. |
| `KgError` / `KgErrorCode` | `kglite::api::KgError`, `KgErrorCode` | Typed errors with 17 stable codes including cancellation. Map code/message/status through the binding. |
| `Embedder` (trait) | `kglite::api::Embedder` | Pluggable text-embedding backend for `text_score()` Cypher. |
| `FastEmbedAdapter` (feature `fastembed`) | `kglite::api::FastEmbedAdapter` | Rust-native ONNX embedder. |
| `SourceLocation` / `SourceLookup` | `kglite::api::*` | Code-entity location lookup result types. |
| `ExploreOptions` / `explore_markdown` | `kglite::api::*` | Codebase exploration as a markdown report. |

## I/O

| Item | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `load_file(path)` | `kglite::api::io::load_file` | Read a `.kgl` file (or disk dir) → `io::Result<Arc<DirGraph>>`. |
| `load_kgl_bytes(&[u8])` | `kglite::api::io::load_kgl_bytes` | Load an in-memory graph from a `.kgl` byte buffer (counterpart of `write_kgl_to`). |
| `save_graph(&mut arc, path)` | `kglite::api::io::save_graph` | Write an `Arc<DirGraph>` → `Result<(), String>`. |
| `write_kgl` / `write_kgl_with(..., fsync)` | `kglite::api::io::write_kgl*` | Atomic (temp+rename) + durable (`fsync`) `.kgl` write. `write_kgl_with` toggles the flush. |
| `write_kgl_to(&graph, &mut writer)` | `kglite::api::io::write_kgl_to` | Serialize the `.kgl` byte stream into any `Write` (backs `to_bytes`). |
| `export_embeddings_to_file(&graph, path, filter, &keys)` | `kglite::api::io::export_embeddings_to_file` | Write node and relationship embedding stores to a standalone `.kgle` file → `ExportStats`. Node-only exports are `.kgle` version 3; an export carrying relationship stores is version 4. |
| `import_embeddings_from_file(&mut graph, path, &keys)` | `kglite::api::io::import_embeddings_from_file` | Install a `.kgle` file's stores by node id and relationship address → `ImportStats` (its `relationships` field is an `EdgeCarryStats`). |
| `RelationshipKeys`, `EdgeCarryStats`, `EmbeddingCopyReport` | `kglite::api::io::*` | The relationship carry: `RelationshipKeys` maps a relationship type to the key property that tells a parallel group's members apart. |

`DirGraph::copy_embeddings_from(&src)` carries node embedding stores across a
rebuild by node id. `DirGraph::copy_embeddings_with_relationships_from(&src,
&keys)` also carries relationship stores and returns an `EmbeddingCopyReport`;
it is the core behind the Python `copy_embeddings_from`. A relationship vector
is addressed by relationship type plus the `(type, id)` of both endpoints. When
several relationships of one type connect the same two nodes, the carry
requires a key property named in `RelationshipKeys` whose value is unique
within the group. It refuses an ambiguous group by name, and the export,
import or copy then writes nothing. `embedding_dim`, `replace_connections`,
`embed_texts(mode=…)` and `freeze` are binding-surface (Python
`KnowledgeGraph`) methods, documented in the Python track, not raw
`kglite::api` functions.

## Embeddings (`kglite::api::embeddings`)

| Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `set_embeddings` / `add_embeddings` / `embed_property` | Write node vectors: replace a store, upsert into one, or compute them through a bound `Embedder`. |
| `build_vector_index` / `refresh_vector_index` / `drop_vector_index` / `has_vector_index` / `list_vector_indexes` | Node HNSW index lifecycle. A built index is saved in `.kgl` (node and relationship alike); disk generations keep neither. `refresh_vector_index` returns `Result<usize, String>`: the vectors it folded in (`0` when current or read-only), or an error when the store or its index does not exist — it never builds one. |
| `list_embeddings(&graph)` → `Vec<EmbeddingStoreInfo>` | Node stores only. The C ABI publishes its `node_type` field verbatim, so relationship stores are not folded in. |
| `list_edge_embeddings(&graph)` → `Vec<EdgeEmbeddingStoreInfo>` | Relationship stores, sorted by type and store. |
| `embedding_info(&graph, EmbeddingEntity, type, column)` | Provenance for one store (dimension, count, model, effective metric, hashed). `EmbeddingEntity::{Node, Relationship}` is explicit because a node type and a relationship type may share a name. |
| `relationship_embeddings(&graph, relationship_type, text_column, &RelationshipKeys)` → `Result<Vec<RelationshipEmbedding>, String>` | Every vector in a relationship store, addressed by endpoint `(type, id)` and ordered by source, target, key, slot — the edge-list plus edge-feature shape. Parallel relationships are told apart by the key property named for their type in `RelationshipKeys`; a named key missing on a member, or repeated within a group, is refused by name. |
| `set_relationship_embeddings` / `add_relationship_embeddings` `(&mut graph, relationship_type, text_column, rows, &RelationshipKeys, metric)` → `Result<RelationshipIngestReport, String>` | Write relationship vectors, each `RelationshipVector` addressed as `relationship_embeddings` reads it back: endpoint `(type, id)` pairs (the types may be `None` when the relationship type has one source and one target node type) plus a key for a parallel-group member. `set_` **replaces** the store (old vectors, metric, provenance and HNSW index discarded), as `set_embeddings` does for nodes; `add_` **upserts**, as `add_embeddings` and `db.edge_embeddings.set` do (same store path, dimension, metric and provenance rules as the procedure). Every row is resolved first; a row naming no relationship, an ambiguous parallel group, a key a member lacks or repeats, or two rows naming one relationship is refused by its position. `From<RelationshipEmbedding>` makes read-modify-write a round trip. |
| `embed_relationship_texts(&mut graph, relationship_type, text_column, EmbedMode, &dyn Embedder, &EmbedHooks, metric)` → `Result<EmbedOutcome, EmbedError>` | Embed every relationship of a type through a bound `Embedder` — the relationship twin of `embed_property`, and the pass `db.edge_embeddings.embed` runs over every relationship of the type. Records the model id and per-relationship text hashes. |
| `embedding_diagnostics(&graph, node_type, relationship_type)` | Coverage rows (`EmbeddingDiagnostic`: an `EmbeddingCoverage` of embedded / embeddable / store-orphan, with `LengthStats`) for node and relationship types. With no filter, every node type and every relationship type is scanned. |

Relationship vectors are queried through Cypher (`db.edge_embeddings.query`,
`vector_score(r, …)`, `text_score(r, …)`), which every binding reaches through
the query pipeline. They are written either in a query
(`db.edge_embeddings.set` / `.embed` over bound relationships) or in bulk
through the two writers above, which share the procedures' store path.

## Schema introspection

| Item | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `compute_description(...)` | `kglite::api::introspection::compute_description` | XML schema description for agent system prompts. |
| `compute_schema(&dir)` | `kglite::api::introspection::compute_schema` | Structured `SchemaOverview` (node types, edge types, indexes). |
| `SchemaOverview`, `ConnectionDetail`, `CypherDetail`, `FluentDetail` | `kglite::api::*` | Structured introspection types. |

## Cypher pipeline (`kglite::api::cypher`)

For building custom pipelines. For the canonical pipeline, use
the `session` module instead.

| Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `parse_cypher(query)` | Parse a query string → `CypherQuery`. Uses the global cache. |
| `validate_schema(&parsed, &graph)` | Schema-check a parsed query against a graph. |
| `rewrite_text_score(...)` | Lower `text_score()` references into vector lookups. |
| `mark_lazy_eligibility(&mut parsed)` | Mark queries eligible for streaming materialization. |
| `optimize(...)` / `planner::*` | Run the optimizer passes; introspect the pipeline. |
| `CypherExecutor` | Execute a planned query against a graph. |
| `execute_mutable(...)` | Mutation execution path. |
| `is_mutation_query(&parsed)` | Heuristic: does this query mutate? |
| `may_invoke_embedder(&parsed)` | Whether the AST contains a callback-capable embedding procedure, including nested query forms. |
| `generate_explain_result(...)` | Build an EXPLAIN-style plan as a CypherResult. |
| `CypherQuery`, `CypherResult`, `OutputFormat` | Data types. |

## Session (canonical query + transaction surface)

The canonical query and transaction pipeline for Rust-side bindings.

| Item | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Session` | `kglite::api::session::Session` | Shared graph state with commit-swap semantics. |
| `Transaction` | `kglite::api::session::Transaction` | Snapshot/working CoW transaction state. |
| `CommitOutcome` | `kglite::api::session::CommitOutcome` | `NoWritesNoOp` / `Committed{new_version}` / `ConflictDetected{current_version, base_version}`. |
| `ExecuteOptions` | `kglite::api::session::ExecuteOptions` | Params, deadline, row/work budget, lazy hint, disabled passes, embedder, value codecs, cancellation, write scope, and provenance. |
| `ExecuteOutcome` | `kglite::api::session::ExecuteOutcome` | `result: CypherResult` + `is_mutation: bool` + `output_format: OutputFormat`. |
| `execute_read(&graph, query, &opts)` | `kglite::api::session::execute_read` | Run a read query. |
| `execute_mut(&mut graph, query, &opts)` | `kglite::api::session::execute_mut` | Run a mutation. |

## Dataset loaders

The pre-packaged dataset loaders (SEC EDGAR, Sodir, Wikidata) are no
longer part of the kglite core API surface — they live in the
separate kglite-datasets project, and `kglite::api::datasets::*` (and
the `sec` / `sodir` / `wikidata` Cargo features) have been removed.
kglite loads the graphs those loaders produce via the ordinary
lifecycle API. To ingest RDF directly, use the kept RDF/N-Triples
loaders.

## Relationship identity migration

Relationship values now carry an executor-only statement incarnation so a
collected relationship cannot silently target a different edge after slot
reuse. Rust callers that constructed `RelValue` with a struct literal should
use `RelValue::new(id, start_id, end_id, rel_type, properties)`; the constructor
sets the internal identity to absent. Its five arguments match the former
public fields.

The identity is invisible to every comparison: `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `Hash`,
`PartialOrd` and `Ord` are hand-written over the five public fields only, so two
`RelValue`s describing the same edge are one key in a `HashSet`, one group under
`DISTINCT` and one position under `ORDER BY` whatever identity they carry. Serde
omits the field, and public result publication clears it. What the identity does
gate is the small set of operations that write through a relationship value —
the `db.edge_embeddings.*` procedures and `DELETE` — which compare the token
explicitly and refuse a value this statement did not bind or whose slot it has
since retired.

Low-level callers constructing `api::cypher::EdgeBinding` directly must add
`incarnation: None` to the literal. Match execution supplies a statement token
internally. Callers that only read `source`, `target`, and `edge_index` require
no change.

## Semver

`kglite::api::*` items above are the documented surface: locked against
accidental drift by the CI API baseline, and every intentional break is
announced in `CHANGELOG.md`. Pre-1.0 that break may arrive in **any** release,
including a patch — see [Stability policy](#stability-policy). Anything outside
that surface — `kglite::graph::*`, `kglite::datatypes::*`, raw module paths —
is internal and may move freely in any release.

| Change kind | Bumps |
|---|---|
| Additive item/options field in `api::*` | Patch or minor, with API baseline update |
| Intentional breaking change before 1.0 | Any release, patch included, plus changelog/migration guidance |
| Internal rearrangement (non-api items) | Patch |

The `.kgl` format is versioned separately from the source API. The current
writer emits RGF v6/Postcard and the reader accepts v6 and v5. RGF
v4/bincode and older containers are
rejected with a clear migration/rebuild path. Convert pre-0.14 artifacts with
kglite 0.13.4 before handing them to a current binding.
