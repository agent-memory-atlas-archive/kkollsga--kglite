//! The whole-frame relationship-constraint gate for the bulk relationship
//! loaders: `add_connections`, `replace_connections`, `create_connections` and
//! `add_edges_from_specs` (the C ABI's and `from_records`' edge path).
//!
//! **Why a pre-pass and not a per-row skip.** The bulk loaders' contract is
//! all-or-nothing on validation: `replace_connections` hoists every check
//! ahead of its delete for exactly this reason (A3c), and a per-row skip here
//! would fork that contract — some rows loaded, some silently dropped, and a
//! `replace` that had already deleted the old edges. So the gate runs over the
//! whole frame before Pass A and **aborts**, exactly as the node-side
//! `gate_batch` does.
//!
//! **Why it must precede Pass A rather than sit inside the flush.** Pass A
//! calls `update_node_titles` per row, which writes — and captures —-
//! immediately; the flush writes edges. Placed any later, a refusal would
//! already have moved the graph and put ops in the change-capture buffer for a
//! statement that failed.
//!
//! **Post-merge semantics.** A row does not simply become an edge: under four
//! of the five conflict modes it merges into whatever the pair already holds.
//! Gating the row in isolation would refuse writes that are legal after the
//! merge (a `Preserve` row whose bad value is discarded) and admit writes that
//! are not (a `Sum` row whose addition promotes an integer to a float). So the
//! gate computes the state each pair will actually end up in and judges that.
//!
//! One invariant does the heavy lifting: **every stored edge of a constrained
//! type already satisfies the constraint**, because installing the constraint
//! scanned the existing data and every write since then came through a gate.
//! That is why a mode which keeps stored values needs no verdict on them.
//!
//! **But a row is not always a merge.** The loader folds rows into edges two
//! different ways, and the gate has to model whichever one will run — a gate
//! that assumes merging admits a violating relationship on the path that does
//! not merge, and one that assumes independence refuses legal writes on the
//! path that does. The condition is `ConnectionBatchProcessor`'s
//! `skip_existence_check`, and it maps onto [`RowFolding`] like this:
//!
//! | Caller | `skip_existence_check` | What the loader does | Gate models |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `add_connections`, the connection type's first load from this source type (`maintain::source_owns_its_edges`) | on | no lookup and no consolidation: **one relationship per row** (`batch.rs`, "within-chunk consolidation is the responsibility of the caller in that mode") | [`RowFolding::Independent`] |
//! | `add_connections`, type already loaded from this source type | off | per-chunk lookup, mutated as rows land, so a row merges into a stored edge *or* into one an earlier row created | [`RowFolding::Merging`] with `read_stored` |
//! | `replace_connections` | delegates to the above | its delete drops the stored edges for these pairs first, but leaves the source type registered on the connection type — so rows still consolidate with each other while nothing stored survives | [`RowFolding::Merging`] **without** `read_stored` (or `Independent` when the type has no edges from this source type yet) |
//! | `add_edges_from_specs` | as `add_connections`, per `(source, target, edge type)` group, always under `update` | the same batch engine; a later group of an already-grouped (edge type, source type) merges | as `add_connections` |
//! | `create_connections` | off | lookup on, so every row merges | [`RowFolding::Merging`] with `read_stored` |
//!
//! Under `Merging` a row folds on the endpoint pair. A declared temporal type
//! ([`ConnectionBatchGate::start_key`]) never merges, whatever the caller: a
//! row identical to a stored or earlier relationship is dropped and any other
//! is a new relationship (`ConnectionBatchProcessor::configure`), so every
//! row is judged as the relationship it creates — a dropped copy's verdict is
//! its stored twin's, which the invariant already made legal.
