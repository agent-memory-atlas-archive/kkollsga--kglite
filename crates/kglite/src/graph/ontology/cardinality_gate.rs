//! The maximum side of declared cardinality, enforced at write time.
//!
//! Semantics match the audit's `cardinality_violation` exactly: a node whose
//! primary type is the declared `domain` (or a declared descendant) must hold
//! at most `max` **outgoing** relationships of the type, parallel edges
//! counted individually. A declaration with no `domain` or no `max` enrols no
//! write rule. The minimum is a "must exist" rule that only a transaction end
//! can judge, so it stays audit-only.
//!
//! Drivers: the Cypher statement-end judge counts each distinct touched
//! `(type, source)` once on the stored graph ([`DirGraph::judge_touched_edges`]);
//! the bulk loaders model the frame's effect on each source's degree
//! ([`judge_frame`]) before anything is written. Cost is
//! O(touched sources x their degree); a graph with no enforced maximum
//! pays nothing, because the cached relationship gate flag stays off.
