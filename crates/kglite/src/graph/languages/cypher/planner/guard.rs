//! Which optimizer passes may run on a scope that carries a guard template
//! (a statement prefixed `FOR VALID_TIME AS OF`). Default-deny: a pass runs
//! under a guard only when it is listed in [`GUARD_SAFE_PASSES`]. Every name
//! in `PASSES` is in exactly one of the two lists with the reason for its
//! verdict, and a test fails when a new pass is in neither.
//!
//! The premise the verdicts rest on: the guard is applied where the pattern
//! matcher accepts an element, so a pass is safe when every row it leaves in
//! the plan still comes out of the matcher. A pass that answers from a
//! store, an index, a count or a precomputed frontier without the matcher
//! would bypass the guard and is denied until it is given a guarded form.

/// Passes that run under a guard, each with why it is safe.
