//! The round-trip contract (VAULT.md §10.9) as a differential corpus.
//!
//! Two properties, over a list of vaults rather than one fixture:
//!
//! - **`export ∘ import ∘ export`** is byte-identical: exporting a graph,
//!   reading the vault back and exporting *that* produces the same tree, file
//!   for file and byte for byte, the manifest included.
//! - **`import ∘ export ∘ import ≡ import`**, apart from §10.9's documented
//!   losses.
//!
//! The losses are taken **once**, on the way out of the author's vault, so the
//! two are asserted together by running three rounds: every vault's second and
//! third export must be byte-identical and their graphs equal — a loss that
//! kept happening would show up there as unbounded drift — and a vault taking
//! no loss that moves bytes must be identical from the *first* export. Then
//! each loss §10.9 names is asserted below as a difference between the first
//! graph and the second that *must* exist. A loss the spec claims and the code
//! does not take is a wrong spec, so the two refinements this phase found
//! ([`a_declared_int_survives_the_round_trip`],
//! [`a_body_stated_edge_keeps_its_properties`]) are asserted as survivals, and
//! §10.9 was rewritten to say so.
//!
//! [`Shape`] is what "graph-equal" means here: the label counter, the
//! edge-type counter, the per-type edge-property counter and every node's
//! property map, rendered to strings so two independently built graphs compare
//! by value.
