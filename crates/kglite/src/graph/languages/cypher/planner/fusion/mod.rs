//! Multi-clause fusion passes — rewrite MATCH+RETURN+AGG, top-K, ORDER BY+LIMIT
//! into specialised physical plans.
//! Note: an earlier draft of this module exposed
//! `match_clause_has_edge_filter` and bailed every fused pass when any
//! edge carried an inline filter. That regressed unfiltered cohort
//! queries by ~250× — the fused histogram fast path got thrown away
//! even though it was still safe to use. The current design keeps
//! fusion enabled and has each fused count helper apply the filter
//! inline (`try_count_simple_pattern`, `try_count_distinct_peers`) or
//! bail itself (`try_fast_with_aggregate_via_histogram`). See those
//! helpers for the details.

/// True when a projection carries a `*`, which no fused operator can project.
///
/// `*` names no item in the AST: the executor expands it from the *runtime
/// row's* bindings (`executor/return_clause.rs::expand_wildcards`), which a
/// fused operator's own projection never builds. Fusing it projects the
/// literal `Star` expression instead, which evaluates to the `1` that exists
/// so `count(*)` has an argument. Two passes have shipped that bug:
/// `MATCH (p:Person) RETURN * ORDER BY p.age DESC LIMIT 2` answered
/// `[{'*': 1}, {'*': 1}]` while the same query without the LIMIT answered the
/// rows, and `MATCH (n:N) RETURN *, count(*) AS c` fused to a column called
/// `*` after the mixed-`*` expansion started producing real columns
/// everywhere else. The unoptimised plan is right in both, so the
/// differential corpus is the detector and carries both shapes.
///
/// Gates that classify items one at a time need this explicitly: a bare
/// `Star` is not an aggregate, so a check shaped "not an aggregate, therefore
/// a group key" accepts it.
