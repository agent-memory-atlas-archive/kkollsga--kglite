//! Statement-end judging of NOT NULL / NODE KEY presence.
//!
//! Neo4j checks existence and key constraints when a statement's changes are
//! committed, not as each clause lands, so `CREATE (n:L) SET n = $props` is
//! valid on a type that requires a property `$props` supplies, and a
//! statement may null a required property and restore it later. The Cypher
//! write path therefore skips the presence check per write, notes the entity
//! it touched here, and judges the *stored* state once the clauses have run
//! (`execute_mutable_with_csv`). A violation fails the statement, and the
//! statement's own rollback undoes every write in it. Type and UNIQUE checks
//! stay per write: a value that is wrong or taken is wrong immediately.
//!
//! Bulk loaders (`add_nodes`, `add_connections`) build each row complete
//! before it is written, so they judge presence per row against the finished
//! row and do not route through here.
