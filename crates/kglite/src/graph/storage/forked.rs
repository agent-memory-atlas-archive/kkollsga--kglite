//! `ForkedGraph` — the writer-side copy-on-write overlay over a shared base.
//!
//! ## What this removes
//!
//! Holding any second `Arc<DirGraph>` — a lazy `ResultView`, a `freeze()`, a
//! `Session`, an open `Transaction` — made the next write deep-copy the entire
//! graph. Measured 2026-08-10 at 1M nodes: **36.3 ms** against a 3.0 µs
//! control, of which the backend row was **37.8 ms of a 41.6 ms**
//! `DirGraph::clone` on a plain graph. This module makes that row O(changes),
//! for node writes and for adjacency writes alike.
//!
//! ## The structural fact that forces this shape
//!
//! The copy-on-write has to be **writer-side**. A reader holds
//! `Arc<DirGraph>` and reads it as `&DirGraph` while the writer wants
//! `&mut DirGraph` to the same allocation — that is aliasing UB, and the only
//! escapes are a lock on the read path (over budget in the MATCH loop) or a
//! read guard that makes writes block on a held Python `ResultView` (a
//! deadlock hazard traded for a latency cliff). So the *reader's* graph is
//! left byte-for-byte untouched and the *writer* builds the delta.
//!
//! ## What the overlay holds
//!
//! | write | forked behaviour |
//! |---|---|
//! | node weight (`SET`, `REMOVE`, labels, title, id) | copied into `nodes` on first touch, O(1) |
//! | `add_node` (`CREATE`, `MERGE` insert) | stored in `nodes` at a predicted slot, O(1) |
//! | `remove_node` | the slot joins `dead` (a base node) or leaves `extra` (an overlay node); incident edges go first |
//! | `add_edge` | stored in the [`EdgeLayer`] at a predicted slot, O(1) |
//! | `remove_edge` | a tombstone (base edge) or an unlink (overlay edge), O(1) |
//! | edge weight (`SET r.p`) | copied into the edge layer on first touch, O(1) |
//! | column-store writes | the overlay owns its own map, O(types) `Arc` bumps at fork |
//!
//! `StableDiGraph` threads adjacency through per-node linked lists with head
//! insertion, so the overlay never touches the base's lists: the edges a node
//! reads are "the overlay's, newest first, then the base's minus the removed"
//! (`forked_edges`), which is exactly the folded graph's order. Reads chain the
//! two behind the shared `Graph*` iterator enums (`forked_edge_iters`); a fork
//! that wrote only nodes hands out the base's own iterators, so the no-overlay
//! read path is unchanged.
//!
//! ## Slot identity, and why forking is *conditional*
//!
//! Rollback guarantees a node or edge comes back on the exact
//! `NodeIndex`/`EdgeIndex` it vacated (`dir_graph/rollback.rs`), and
//! `NodeIndex` is the key of every index structure on `DirGraph`. So the
//! indices the overlay hands out must be the indices the base will produce when
//! the overlay is folded back in. `StableGraph::add_node` and `add_edge` reuse
//! free-list slots (LIFO) and offer no index-controlled insertion, so the
//! overlay allocates exactly as they would: each index is the
//! [`SlotMirror`](super::slot_mirror) prediction — the free-list head while the
//! list is non-empty, then the next slot past every one ever allocated.
//!
//! Removals feed the same free lists, so a fold cannot replay "the appended
//! nodes in allocation order" any more: it replays the **operation log**
//! (`Op`) — every add and remove, in the order the writer issued them —
//! against the base's own `add_node` / `add_edge` / `remove_edge` /
//! `remove_node`, and each add must come back on the slot the overlay handed
//! out. A log that reproduces every slot reproduces both free lists and the
//! adjacency order, because the same operations ran against the same state.
//! Issue #195 was an overlay that appended past `node_bound()` while slots
//! were still listed.
//!
//! That needs a mirror whose free-list order is known, which is what
//! [`can_fork`] checks. The fold simulates the log against a copy of the
//! target's mirror before anything changes (`Overlay::check`), then replays it
//! checking each slot petgraph actually allocates. A slot mismatch while the
//! replay has only added things is undone and the overlay keeps serving; once a
//! removal has run the replay cannot be reversed (re-adding an edge puts it at
//! the head of its lists, not where it was), so a mismatch there can only
//! panic. It cannot happen while the mirror agrees with petgraph, which the
//! debug assertion in `SlotMirror::note_*_added` checks on every insert the
//! test suites perform. A base that cannot be forked falls back to the deep
//! clone, which is slower and never wrong — the same fail-safe direction
//! `rollback::journal_covers` takes.
