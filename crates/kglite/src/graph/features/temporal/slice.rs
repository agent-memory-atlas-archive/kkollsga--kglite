//! The valid slice: a materialised graph holding only the elements valid at
//! one instant, for a consumer that needs a whole graph rather than a guarded
//! walk over the base (an algorithm that iterates `graph.graph` directly).
//!
//! A node is kept when the resolved [`ElementFilter`] admits it — valid under
//! every declared label it carries. A relationship is kept when the filter
//! admits it (its own declaration, keyed on its source node's type) **and**
//! both its endpoints are kept, the same hop rule the guarded matcher applies.
//! Every test goes through the filter's admit functions, which read a mask bit
//! where the endpoint index gave one and evaluate the bound properties where
//! it did not (Disk mode, an unreadable bound, the byte cap), so a slice is
//! correct whichever targets are indexed.
//!
//! The slice keeps user ids (`id(n)` answers as on the base) and renumbers
//! physical indexes: `to_base` takes a slice node back to its base node, so
//! rows an algorithm produces on the slice can be joined to the base. It
//! copies secondary labels, the ontology and the schema; it does **not** copy
//! temporal declarations (the slice is already as of its instant),
//! embeddings, text or vector indexes.
//!
//! The copy is a fresh in-memory graph with its own column stores, holding
//! only the kept nodes' rows; it never shares the base's stores, which in
//! mapped and Disk mode are file-backed and would be copied onto the heap
//! whole by the first write.
//!
//! Two caps bound it. Every mode: the slice's bytes (see
//! [`ValidSlice::bytes`]) against [`SLICE_BYTE_CAP`] — over it the slice is
//! refused, and the cache of slices evicts oldest first to stay under it.
//! Disk mode also counts admitted elements against
//! [`DISK_SLICE_ELEMENT_CAP`] while it walks, and refuses as soon as the walk
//! passes it. The walk holds only the admitted nodes and relationships —
//! nothing sized by the base graph — so on Disk its lists never grow past
//! the cap.
