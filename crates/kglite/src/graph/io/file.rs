//   [5..9]     core_data_version: u32 LE

//   [13..13+N] JSON metadata (column schemas, section sizes, section
//              integrity digests, all config); v8 appends a CRC32 (LE) over
//              bytes [0..13] and the JSON, counted in N
//   [section]  topology.zst — graph structure WITHOUT node properties
//   [section]  columns_<Type>.zst — one per node type, packed column data
//   [section]  embeddings.zst (optional)
//   [section]  edge_embeddings.zst (required for core v4; absent from core v3)
//   [section]  timeseries.zst (optional)
//   [section]  secondary_labels.zst (optional)

//
// v6 vs v5: the section layout, metadata schema and codec are unchanged. What
// v6 adds is a per-column encoding choice inside the packed column sections —
// an `Int64` column may be written as `"int64d"` (zigzag-varint deltas) when
// that is smaller than the fixed-width `"int64"` array, and is re-typed to the
// same in-memory column on load. A v5 reader would take the unknown tag for a
// `Mixed` column and fail decoding it, so the container version is what stops
// it: 0.15.14 refuses a v6 file by version number.
//
// v7 vs v6: the section layout, metadata schema and codec are unchanged. What
// v7 adds is content inside the packed column sections: a `"timestamp"` column
// (microseconds) and an `Int64` title column where v6 wrote them as `Mixed`.
// A v6 reader would misparse those, so it refuses a v7 file by version number
// ("Please upgrade kglite").
//
// v8 vs v7: the section layout and codec are unchanged. v8 adds the metadata
// CRC32 trailer — before it, one flipped byte in the metadata JSON or the length
// fields was parsed (or misparsed) rather than detected — and allows a
// `Value::Duration` with a sub-second part, written under a serde tag a v7
// reader rejects. Section payloads keep their own per-section digests. This
// writer emits v8 only; v5, v6 and v7 are still read, and a v7 reader refuses a
// v8 file by version number (the shipped 0.19.x wording says "older version",
// wrong in direction — see CHANGELOG).
//
// v9 vs v8: v8's bytes, then a data region of raw sections (embedding and
// column payloads) that a reader can map instead of decompress. Written only
// when a save supplies at least one such section, so a graph without them
// produces v8 bytes exactly. Layout:
//   [..]       v8 header, metadata (+ CRC32) and compressed sections, as above
//   [pad]      zeros up to the next 64-byte boundary — the data-region base
//   [region]   mappable sections, each at a 64-byte-aligned offset
// `FileMetadata::mappable` tables them (offset relative to the base, length,
// dtype, flags, CRC32); see `io::file::mappable`. A v8 reader refuses the file
// by container version ("Please upgrade kglite"); `SaveLayout::Compact` is the
// writer's way to keep producing v8.
//
// Pre-v5 magic values are retained only for explicit rejection and migration
// guidance; their payloads are never decoded by the current reader.

// ─── Section integrity ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every section in the container is covered twice:
//
//  1. Its zstd frame carries an XXH64 content checksum (`include_checksum`),
//     which the decoder verifies on its own with no cooperation from us. Costs
//     4 bytes per section and catches damage inside the compressed payload.
//  2. `FileMetadata::section_digests` records a CRC32 of the *compressed*
//     bytes, verified in `SectionCursor::take` before a byte reaches zstd.
//
// Both are cheap enough to run eagerly on every load, but only because the
// CRC is hardware-accelerated: measured on a 180 MB `.kgl` (release, arm64,
// min of 5), layer 1 costs ~20 ms (+4.7%) and layer 2 ~14 ms over a
// digest-free 423 ms load. The software-table CRC that 0.16.6 shipped cost
// ~360 ms (+85%) on its own, which is the regression this note now guards
// against: keep `section_digest` on an accelerated implementation.
//
// Layer 2 exists because layer 1 only protects what a decoder chooses to
// decode: a flipped bit that lands where the section *boundaries* are read
// from, or in a section a reader skips, never reaches an XXH64 check. It also
// covers files written by a build that had checksums off.
//
// Both layers are additive: an older binary ignores the unknown JSON key and
// zstd frames with a content checksum are ordinary zstd frames, so a file
// written here still loads on a build that predates this. A file written
// *before* this carries no digests, and `take` then verifies nothing — exactly
// its previous behaviour.
